# RunnerBuddy — v0.2 Remaining Work

This file originally tracked the unfinished items from the v0.2 plan. Everything here is now implemented end-to-end except the optional rollback action below.

## Remaining

- Optional: add a rollback action that switches a moved runner back to `install.adopted_from_path` (and cleans up the managed copy) when verification fails.
